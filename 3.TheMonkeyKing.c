# A group of monkeys want to elect a king based on the following rules. 

# 	a. everyone is sitting in a circle and get number in clockwise direction from 0 to n-1
# b. with a given number m that is set up before, count each one in clockwise direction     from 1 to m, and then m^th monkey will be out from the competition.
# c. after that, re-assign number right after m^th monkey for each from 0 to n-2
# 	d. repeat above step b and c until the last one is left. And it will be the king. 
# 	e. the program running result should be kingâ€™s number in step a

# 	 Output
# 		Enter total number of monkeys in a group: 5
# 		Enter m value: 3
# 		The king will be 3

# 		Enter total number of monkeys in a group: 8
# 		Enter m value: 5
# 		The king will be 2
